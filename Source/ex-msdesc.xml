        <p>During this exercise you will learn : <list type="bulleted">
            <item>how to create a basic manuscript description </item>
            <item>how the various components of a TEI manuscript description are organized</item>

      <div>
        <head>A minimal <gi>msDesc</gi></head>
        <p>A manuscript description, as the name suggests, describes a manuscript. The description
          can be rich and complex, or very simple. The same applies to its markup. Let's begin with
          the absolute minimum.</p>
        <p>A manuscript description should always tell you <list>
            <item>where the manuscript is to be found : <gi>msIdentifier</gi>
            </item>
            <item>what the manuscript contains : <gi>msContents</gi> or <gi>p</gi></item>
            <item>and probably something about its physical composition, size etc.
                (<gi>physDesc</gi> or <gi>p</gi>)</item>
          </list></p>
        <p>Of course it may contain much, much more, as we will see...</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <head>Getting started</head>

        <p>In this exercise we will create a TEI document which contains a manuscript description,
          marked up with the TEI <gi>msDesc</gi> element. </p>
        <list>
          <item>Open oXygen, and create a new XML document using the template provided for a P5
            Manuscript Description <list>
              <item>Select New from the File menu (CTRL-N)</item>
              <item>Scroll down to Framework Templates in the New dialog</item>
              <item>Open TEI P5, and select Manuscript description </item>
            </list></item>
          <item>oXygen creates a template for you to fill which looks more or less like this
            <lb/>
            <graphic url="../images/msDescSkel.png"/></item>
          <item>First, fill in the TEI header as follows <list>
              <item>The <gi>title</gi> is something like <q>TEI Conformant description of a
                  manuscript</q></item>
              <item>The <gi>publicationStmt</gi> says something like <q>Unpublished
                exercise</q></item>
              <item>The <gi>sourceDesc</gi> for the moment says simply <q>No pre-existing
                source</q></item>
              <item>If you like, you could add a <gi>respStmt</gi> containing a <gi>resp</gi> such
                as <code>TEI Encoding</code> and a <gi>name</gi> containing your own name. Do you
                know where this element can go? How would you find out? </item>
            </list></item>
          <item>Next, fill in the <gi>msIdentifier</gi> as follows <list>
              <item>In the <gi>settlement</gi> element, give the name of the city (town, village,
                etc.) where your manuscript is currently stored (<q>Sofia</q>)</item>
              <item>In the <gi>repository</gi> element, give the name of the repository
                (institution, library, etc.) which holds it (<q>Национална Библиотека "Св. Св. Кирил
                  и Методий"</q>)</item>
              <item>In the <gi>idno</gi> element give the shelf mark, call number or similar for
                your manuscript (<q>1144</q>) </item>
            </list></item>
          <item>This is all that is needed for a valid manuscript description. But to make it
            useful, you may wish to add a little more information. You could supply this as a
              <gi>head</gi> element, for example containing the text <q>Short Apostle Lectionary in
              Russian, written in Cyrillic script by a single hand</q>. Or you could add a series of
              <gi>p</gi> or <gi>ab</gi> elements providing whatever information you choose. Or you
            could use some of the more specialised elements provided by the TEI, as follows.</item>
          <item>After the <gi>msIdentifier</gi>, add a <gi>msContents</gi> element to provide
            information about the <soCalled>intellectual content</soCalled> of the manuscript. In
            the simplest case, you might just want to summarise this, using a <gi>summary</gi>
            element. </item>
          <item>After the <gi>msContent</gi> element, add a <gi>physDesc</gi> element to describe
            the physical aspects of the manuscript. In the simplest case, you could provide this as
            one or more paragraphs (<gi>p</gi>) elements. </item>

        </list>

        <p>Your minimal <gi>msDesc</gi> should look something like this: <egXML
            xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
            <msDesc>
              <msIdentifier>
                <settlement>Sofia</settlement>
                <repository>National Library</repository>
                <idno>1144</idno>
              </msIdentifier>
              <head>Apostle Lectionary, in Russian, written in Cyrillic script by a single
                hand</head>
              <msContents>
                <summary>Apostle Lectionary in Russian</summary>
              </msContents>
              <physDesc>
                <p>Parchment, 39 folios, written in Cyrillic script by a single hand. Some damage to
                  outer leaves. </p>
              </physDesc>
            </msDesc>
          </egXML></p>
        <p>Since the <gi>head</gi> element now adds nothing to the rest of the description, you
          might like to remove it. </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <head>A more ambitious description</head>
        <p>In this part of the exercise, we will first convert a pre-existing manuscript description
          from word processor format (Word or Libre Office) into TEI XML. We will then consider how
          each part of the description could be marked up in a TEI msDesc. </p>
        <list>
          <item>Browse to your <ident>Work</ident> folder and click on either the file
              <ident>LUL_Ms40.odt</ident> (if you have Libre Office) or <ident>LUL_Ms40.docx</ident>
            (if you have Microsoft Word) to open it. Take a quick look at its contents and close the
            word processor application again. </item>
          <item>Now, in oXygen, choose File - Open, navigate to this file, and open it again</item>
          <item>A new window labelled <ident>Archive Browser</ident> opens, showing the structure of
            the word processor file, which is actually a collection of several files. Find the file
            called <ident>content.xml</ident> (for an .odt file), or
              <ident>Word/document.xml</ident> (for a .docx file) and open it by double clicking on
            it</item>
          <item>As you can see, this is actually an XML file, although it uses a different non-TEI
            set of tags. We will use oXygen to convert it automatically into a basic TEI document. <list>
              <!--<item>In oXygen, use the usual Open dialog to select the docx file</item>
              <item>A window labelled <code>Archive Browser</code> opens to the left of the main
                screen. It shows the file structure of the docx archive.</item>
              <item><graphic url="media/en/archive-browser.png" height="4cm"/></item>
              <item>Click the blue key next to the folder called <ident>word </ident> to see the
                contents of this folder</item>
              <item><graphic url="media/en/archive-browser-2.png" height="4cm"/></item>
              <item>Select the file called <ident> document.xml</ident> and double click to open it
                (may take a few moments if the file is large)</item>-->
              <item><!--With the <ident>document.xml</ident> file open in your main editing window,-->
                Select <ident>Transformation -> Configure Transformation Scenario(s)</ident> from
                the <ident>Document</ident> menu. Or type <code>CTRL-SHIFT-C</code>. Or click the
                little spanner icon</item>
              <item>Check the little box next to DOCX TEI P5 (or ODT TEI P5) and press the
                  <ident>Apply Associated</ident> button.</item>
              <item>After a brief pause, a new window opens in which a basic TEI P5 version of the
                document appears. Click the Format and Indent button (CTRL-SHIFT-I) to see its
                structure, which should look familiar to you!</item>

        <head>Self-Assessment</head>
        <p>Check if you understand some of the core principles of this exercise by answering the
          following questions: <list>
            <item>What is the only required aspect of a TEI manuscript description?</item>
            <item>How does one record the separate works of intellectual content present in the
              manuscript? </item>
            <item>Where does one describe the support which forms the object, or its layout?</item>
            <item>How does one record the origin, provenance, and acquisition of the object?</item>

        <head>Next and More Reading</head>
        <p> Next we'll be looking at more encoding one can add to manuscripts, particularly for
          transcriptions. However, before that if you have time you may wish to:<list>
            <item>Look up the reference pages for each of the new elements you've used.</item>
            <item>Read some of the chapter on Manuscript Description: <ref
