        <p>During this exercise you will learn : <list type="bulleted">
            <item>how to create a basic manuscript description </item>
            <item>how the various components of a TEI manuscript description are organized</item>
            <item>how to create a detailed manuscript description</item>

      </div>



      <div>
        <head>A minimal <gi>msDesc</gi></head>
        <p>A manuscript description, as the name suggests, describes a manuscript. The description
          can be rich and complex, or very simple. The same applies to its markup. Let's begin with
          the absolute minimum.</p>
        <p>A manuscript description should always tell you <list>
            <item>where the manuscript is to be found : <gi>msIdentifier</gi>
            </item>
            <item>what the manuscript contains : <gi>msContents</gi> or <gi>p</gi></item>
            <item>and probably something about its physical composition, size etc.
                (<gi>physDesc</gi> or <gi>p</gi>)</item>
          </list></p>
        <p>Of course it may contain much, much more, as we will see...</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <head>Getting started</head>

        <p>In this exercise we will create a TEI document which contains a manuscript description,
          marked up with the TEI <gi>msDesc</gi> element. </p>
        <list>
          <item>Open oXygen, and create a new XML document using the template provided for a P5
            Manuscript Description <list>
              <item>Select New from the File menu (CTRL-N)</item>
              <item>Scroll down to Framework Templates in the New dialog</item>
              <item>Open TEI P5, and select Manuscript description </item>
            </list></item>
          <item>oXygen creates a template for you to fill which looks more or less like this
            <lb/>
            <graphic url="../images/msDescSkel.png"/></item>
          <item>First, fill in the TEI header as follows <list>
              <item>The <gi>title</gi> is something like <q>TEI Conformant description of a
                  manuscript</q></item>
              <item>The <gi>publicationStmt</gi> says something like <q>Unpublished
                exercise</q></item>
              <item>The <gi>sourceDesc</gi> for the moment says simply <q>No pre-existing
                source</q></item>
              <item>If you like, you could add a <gi>respStmt</gi> containing a <gi>resp</gi> such
                as <code>TEI Encoding</code> and a <gi>name</gi> containing your own name. Do you
                know where this element can go? How would you find out? </item>
            </list></item>
          <item>Next, fill in the <gi>msIdentifier</gi> as follows <list>
              <item>In the <gi>settlement</gi> element, give the name of the city (town, village,
                etc.) where your manuscript is currently stored (<q>Sofia</q>)</item>
              <item>In the <gi>repository</gi> element, give the name of the repository
                (institution, library, etc.) which holds it (<q>Национална Библиотека "Св. Св. Кирил
                  и Методий"</q>)</item>
              <item>In the <gi>idno</gi> element give the shelf mark, call number or similar for
                your manuscript (<q>1144</q>) </item>
            </list></item>
          <item>This is all that is needed for a valid manuscript description. But to make it
            useful, you may wish to add a little more information. You could supply this as a
              <gi>head</gi> element, for example containing the text <q>Short Apostle Lectionary in
              Russian, written in Cyrillic script by a single hand</q>. Or you could add a series of <gi>p</gi> or
              <gi>ab</gi> elements providing whatever information you choose. Or you could use some
            of the more specialised elements provided by the TEI, as follows.</item>
          <item>After the <gi>msIdentifier</gi>, add a <gi>msContents</gi> element to provide
            information about the <soCalled>intellectual content</soCalled> of the manuscript. In
            the simplest case, you might just want to summarise this, using a <gi>summary</gi>
            element. </item>
          <item>After the <gi>msContent</gi> element, add a <gi>physDesc</gi> element to describe
            the physical aspects of the manuscript. In the simplest case, you could provide this as
            one or more paragraphs (<gi>p</gi>) elements. </item>

        </list>
        
        <p>Your minimal <gi>msDesc</gi> should look something like this: <egXML
          xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
          <msDesc>
            <msIdentifier>
              <settlement>Sofia</settlement>
              <repository>National Library</repository>
              <idno>1144</idno>
            </msIdentifier>
            <head>Apostle Lectionary, in Russian, written in Cyrillic script by a single
              hand</head>
            <msContents>
              <summary>Apostle Lectionary in Russian</summary>
            </msContents>
            <physDesc>
              <p>Parchment, 39 folios, written in Cyrillic script by a single  hand. Some damage to outer
                leaves. </p>
            </physDesc>
          </msDesc>
        </egXML></p>
        <p>Since the <gi>head</gi> element now adds nothing to the rest of the description, you might like to remove it. </p>
      </div>


      <!-- Self-Assessment -->
      <div>
        <head>Self-Assessment</head>
        <p>Check if you understand some of the core principles of this exercise by answering the
          following questions: <list>
            <item>What is the only required aspect of a TEI manuscript description?</item>
            <item>How does one record the separate works of intellectual content present in the
              manuscript? </item>
            <item>Where does one describe the support which forms the object, or its layout?</item>
            <item>How does one record the origin, provenance, and acquisition of the object?</item>
   
          </list>
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Next  -->
      <div>
        <head>Next and More Reading</head>
        <p> Next we'll be looking at more encoding one can add to manuscripts, particularly for
          transcriptions. However, before that if you have time you may wish to:<list>
            <item>Look up the reference pages for each of the new elements you've used.</item>
            <item>Read some of the chapter on Manuscript Description: <ref
                target="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/MS.html"
                >http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/MS.html</ref>.</item>
