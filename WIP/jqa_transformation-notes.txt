Converting JQA from OxGarage to personography

Import into <oXygen/>.
Validate; delete final two truncated "sheets" to correct invalidities.

Every row has content in some cell
No cell is obligatory
No cell has an xml:id; use the @n values instead, prepending "n"
All other cells are present for at least one row
It is not the case that every entry has a surname (!)

During transformation, normalize space for both input testing and output creation.
